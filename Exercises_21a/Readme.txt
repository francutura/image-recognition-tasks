(1) Place in the working directory the following
auxiliary files:

Simple_MNIST_NN_from_scratch_11.py
Var__noise1.py
im1__4__.pgm
im3__0__.pgm
im5__5__.pgm
train.csv
test.csv

- The training data set (train.csv) can be found at:
https://app.box.com/s/wg99hpaosqe5rhsyrliguz6c666ksxtk

- The test data set (test.csv) can be found at:
https://app.box.com/s/fa8qi7t4y5xyerzws0h3j9fh6mv2ikjw




(2) Launch python as:
python -i Var__noise1.py

Or, depending on the installation: python3 -i Var__noise1.py


During the execution, some sample images are shown,
and the correct label and prediction are printed.


NOTE: in the python interpreter, execute the instructions:
i1 = im1__4__; print(call__make_predictions(i1))

They would normally print the correct result:
the 4 digit (particularly, '[4]'). If it is not the
case, please quit and execute again
python -i Var__noise1
until print(call__make_predictions(i1)) displays that
correct result. (The reason is that, for the following
items, im1__4__ should be correctly classified after
some randomized initializations, etc. that have been
performed.)


(3) In the python interpreter, experiment with sample
image "im1__4__.pgm" (which corresponds to digit 4):


# Classification without and with noise (standard deviation: 5.0):
in1, _ = call__make_predictions__adding__noise(i1, 5.0)




(4) Increase the standard deviation of the noise
in increments of 5.0 until the classification fails,
and save the corresponding noisy image as:
im1__4__noisy.pgm

(with 10.0 prediction is 9)

# Write the noisy image
cv2.imwrite('im1__4__noisy.pgm', in1.reshape((28, 28)))




(5) For the noisy image obtained in (4), try if
applying a previous filtering can achieve a successful
classification, and save the corresponding filtered
image as:
im1__4__filtered.pgm

In order to do that, use the auxiliary function
'call__make_predictions__with__filtering'
as in the following example:

if1, _ = call__make_predictions__with__filtering(in1)
cv2.imwrite('im1__4__filtered.pgm', if1.reshape((28, 28)))


Note: call__make_predictions__with__filtering has
an optional argument named 'if_open' (with default
value False). If 'if_open' is True, only an
opening is performed; otherwise, a close-open
filtering is applied.





The outputs of this exercise to be returned are:
im1__4__noisy.pgm
im1__4__filtered.pgm
